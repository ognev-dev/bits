echo "Staring project deploy"

# This is straightforward deploy to linux server that does the job for me for now.
# Probably later I'll need to add a hook to deploy on merge to main branch

# Note to windows users: I used to use this script on linux, but it works surprisingly as expected on windows
#   Only what you need is Git Bash terminal which comes with Git for Windows installation
#     If you don't have Git Bash yet, you can get from Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win


# how to use:
# 1. copy this file to ../bin or elsewhere you like (../bin is convenient because it is in project dir and out of git)
# 2. set variables that is just right below
#     note that some config values is out of variables,
#     jump to "Writing config" line and make sure that everything is correct there
# 3. run this script

# remote's requirements:
# 1. supervisor must be installed and config for supervisor to run server must be created
#     (look at ../scripts/supervisor.conf for example)
#    if you use something else, delete lines here that stop and start supervisor
# 2. postgres database configured and running

# Note: during deploy you'll need to authenticate at remote twice
#   (1. uploading files with scp; 2. setting up with ssh)
#   if you do deploy often, it is obviously useful to do authentication automatically using authentication keys
#   to do so follow steps from http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html
#   That guide will help you generate a pair of authentication keys
#   so you can deploy seamlessly
